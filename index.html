    <p>Hi! My name is Anastasia Johansen. I enjoy dancing, drawing, hiking, and playing video games. I also love math and science.</p>
    <p>My major is Software Engineering, though I am still investigating if this is truly what I desire. I am taking this class mostly because it is required for my major (as opposed to seeking a career in websites), but I am still curious to learn more about web design. I look forward to learning more in this class.</p>
